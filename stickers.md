Note: Some of the sticker symbols can't be identified by picture because the image quality isn't detailed enough to determine which of the 9 pieces it is. However, since it is a repeating pattern, we know which symbol belongs to each sticker number. These stickers have been filled using the pattern: 038(B), 065(B), 193(D), 194(E), 221(E), 252(I), 597(C).

The pattern is as follows:

```001 = A, 002 = B, 003 = C, 004 = D, 005 = E, 006 = F, 007 = G, 008 = H, 009 = I```

and then it repeats (010 = A, 011 = B, 012 = C, etc).

## Lost stickers

Stickers which have been confirmed, or strongly believed to be lost.

"L" codes (such as "L01") will be used to easily identify each lost sticker.

## Unknown stickers

Stickers that we know exist, but don't know what they are.

"U" codes (such as "U01") will be used to easily identify each unknown sticker.

- U01 - [Youtube-IGN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqlQaHgRaHg) And Twitter: [DMC_Ryan](https://twitter.com/DMC_Ryan/status/1135661784612818945) + [LawofTD](https://twitter.com/LawofTD/status/1205263277153902595) + [Terri_Schwartz](https://twitter.com/Terri_Schwartz/status/1207388390561218560) + [DanStapleton](https://twitter.com/DanStapleton/status/1268671570672644099) + [USofJR](https://twitter.com/USofJR/status/1268696107397206016) + [jonmgibson](https://twitter.com/jonmgibson/status/1268738116963102721) + [Gameonysus](https://twitter.com/Gameonysus) + [SWAIM_CORP](https://twitter.com/SWAIM_CORP/status/1215013640610312192) - Symbol can be seen as a slash: ["/"](https://youtu.be/gqlQaHgRaHg?t=52) - Was first found on Youtube and contacted on Email and Twitter by PitchBright. dragonslayer875 did also contact IGN. At last via Raezores, I managed to find all of the Twitter links you see above over a longer period of time that I don't remember exactly. By using all different kinds of varieties of search words as seen above, I ended up finding DMC_Ryan's post and several of the ones above. By tweeting and DM'ing the different people, I got leads to the other collector's editions that the guys had posted, and when I eventually found the last one, I asked for confirmation if they were all the same, which they was. I don't remember the process of finding them all down to the detail because theres so many links and people, but by going through lots of tweets & replies and media in potential owners and checking retweets, comments and posts about extremly many different posts about collector's edition, I eventually ended up with the final result in the end that you see above. There are so many dates that I won't put them because of confusion, but I was updated that they will check when they get back to the office which will probably be in a long time.
- U02 - [Youtube-Giant Bomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7OqMKBbM2Y) + [Instagram Giant Bomb](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5_hdYslfQh/) + Twitter user [bradshoemaker](https://twitter.com/frailgesture/status/1249831772281397248) - Symbol can be seen as a dash: [“-”](https://youtu.be/Y7OqMKBbM2Y?t=129) - EM-PitchBri & TW-Raezor & dragon - was found first on Youtube by PitchBright and dragonslayer875. PitchBright contacted Giant Bomb via email, and dragonslayer875 via Giant Bomb on Twitter. After some time I, Raezores found the Huddle image on Instagram as seen in the link above via the hashtag "#realdoll". I then tweeted out to Giant Bomb on Twitter, and as you see in the Twitter link above [frailgesture](https://twitter.com/frailgesture) replied to the tweet that Twitter user [bradshoemaker](https://twitter.com/bradshoemaker) would have some info. We tried reaching out to Brad with no answers, but I eventually DM'd frailgesture which confirmed the "statue" (Huddle) was in the office and they wouldn't go back there for months. He also didn't know if the sticker was still there or not. 15.04.2020
