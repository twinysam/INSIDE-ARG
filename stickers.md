Note: Some of the sticker symbols can't be identified by picture because the image quality isn't detailed enough to determine which of the 9 pieces it is. However, since it is a repeating pattern, we know which symbol belongs to each sticker number. These stickers have been filled using the pattern: 038(B), 065(B), 193(D), 194(E), 221(E), 252(I), 597(C).

The pattern is as follows:

```001 = A, 002 = B, 003 = C, 004 = D, 005 = E, 006 = F, 007 = G, 008 = H, 009 = I```

and then it repeats (010 = A, 011 = B, 012 = C, etc).

Stickers that we know exist, but don't know what they are.

"U" codes (such as "U01") will be used to easily identify each unknown sticker.

- U01 - [Youtube-IGN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqlQaHgRaHg) And Twitter: [DMC_Ryan](https://twitter.com/DMC_Ryan/status/1135661784612818945) + [LawofTD](https://twitter.com/LawofTD/status/1205263277153902595) + [Terri_Schwartz](https://twitter.com/Terri_Schwartz/status/1207388390561218560) + [DanStapleton](https://twitter.com/DanStapleton/status/1268671570672644099) + [USofJR](https://twitter.com/USofJR/status/1268696107397206016) + [jonmgibson](https://twitter.com/jonmgibson/status/1268738116963102721) + [Gameonysus](https://twitter.com/Gameonysus) + [SWAIM_CORP](https://twitter.com/SWAIM_CORP/status/1215013640610312192) - Symbol can be seen as a slash: ["/"](https://youtu.be/gqlQaHgRaHg?t=52) - Was first found on Youtube and contacted on Email and Twitter by PitchBright. dragonslayer875 did also contact IGN. At last via Raezores, I managed to find all of the Twitter links you see above over a longer period of time that I don't remember exactly. By using all different kinds of varieties of search words as seen above, I ended up finding DMC_Ryan's post and several of the ones above. By tweeting and DM'ing the different people, I got leads to the other collector's editions that the guys had posted, and when I eventually found the last one, I asked for confirmation if they were all the same, which they was. I don't remember the process of finding them all down to the detail because theres so many links and people, but by going through lots of tweets & replies and media in potential owners and checking retweets, comments and posts about extremly many different posts about collector's edition, I eventually ended up with the final result in the end that you see above. There are so many dates that I won't put them because of confusion, but I was updated that they will check when they get back to the office which will probably be in a long time.

PitchBright contacted Giant Bomb via email, and dragonslayer875 via Giant Bomb on Twitter. After some time I, Raezores found the Huddle image on Instagram as seen in the link above via the hashtag "#realdoll". I then tweeted out to Giant Bomb on Twitter, and as you see in the Twitter link above [frailgesture](https://twitter.com/frailgesture) replied to the tweet that Twitter user [bradshoemaker](https://twitter.com/bradshoemaker) would have some info. We tried reaching out to Brad with no answers, but I eventually DM'd frailgesture which confirmed the "statue" (Huddle) was in the office and they wouldn't go back there for months. He also didn't know if the sticker was still there or not. 15.04.2020. **Update:** new message sent by Discord user DarkMatter on Twitter, Twitter user frailgesture/Matthew Rorie confirmed in [this post](https://twitter.com/frailgesture/status/1628508235052507136) that the sticker most likely is lost.

- U16 - Instagram/Email [@playdeadgames](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCJNrpqgteP/) - via Raezores - was found via checking the posts that Playdead is tagged in. Instagram user [@safrro](https://www.instagram.com/safrro/) tagged Playdead in a post she made with a thanks for the visit at their place in an Instagram post she made with an image displaying the Huddle in Playdead's headquarters. This could mean that Playdead also owns a Collector's Edition of INSIDE, but we don't know for sure. The fact that they have a Huddle doesn't necessarily mean they would have a sticker. 03.07.2020 **Update:** after reaching out to Andreas Normand Grøntved (lead animator at Playdead) via email, through back and forth communication, he eventually confirmed he couldn't locate any stickers. This could mean the one in their office isn't part of the ARG at all, which is why I let this one remain as unknown. 24.12.2022

Contacted again, no answer. 10.08.2023. Contacted again, he replied that he wishes to keep everything sealed.

**Note regarding the use of Discord**
 
We have added links to the Discord sources where possible. Some of them won't have it because contact happened via private messages, or through another platform entirely. It should also be noted that some Discord users have abandoned the server and/or deleted their accounts. This affects the ability to search for material referencing them. Discord users can also change their user name, this means that some of the Discord names mentioned above might not be up to date and thus not reflect their current user name. We try to keep this updated if/when there any significant reasons which might cause confusion. However, Discord users changing names or leaving the server is something we cannot keep track of, it is simply outside of our control.

That said, Discord links are permanent, so they will continue to point to the relevant discussions regardless of users changing their names or deleting their accounts.


## Research
