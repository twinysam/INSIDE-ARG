# INSIDE ARG Documentation

This repository is meant to keep a public record of most events and relevant discoveries and progress in solving the mysteries of this [ARG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game). Thus making it easier to jump in on it while it's ongoing and contribute in helping solve it.

## About INSIDE & the ARG

[INSIDE](https://playdead.com/games/inside) is a video game made by Playdead and first released in June 29, 2016. (Here is a [full playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4MkqbKieU))

Early on, hidden things were discovered in the game. Some of these lead us to secret websites and other clues and puzzles started happening outside of the game.
Playdead has been hinting at their upcoming game with it.

The ongoing effort to solve the puzzles and mysteries is happening at the unofficial Playdead Discord server: https://discord.gg/gQ74gaa

## Catching Up

This is required reading to understand what has happened so far, and the state of some of the currently active puzzles.

### Collector's Edition Stickers

Playdead in collaboration with iam8bit made a special collector's edition (hereby referred to as CE) limited to 1000 copies.

It started to be received by December 12, 2019. That's when iam8bit released this making of video, revealing the content of the CE which was previously unknown: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vG2A0BjMiY

And this is the final result itself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhCdGdqCIRU

The **stickers** that seal the wrapping contain a puzzle.

This is what those stickers look like: 

![Collector's Edition sticker](https://i.imgur.com/1mLxx7Z.png)

The community has since been trying to get detailed pictures of each. We are gathering every sticker we've found here: https://github.com/twinysam/INSIDE-ARG/tree/master/images/stickers

This is what we know so far:

- Each sticker has a unique three digit number (supposedly that would be the copy number, from 001, or 000 to 999)
- Each sticker has one of three symbols: a dot, a slash or a dash.
- Each sticker has one of nine different texture images. (We have identified them with letters, from A to I)

The effort to track down as many different copies of the CE as possible, is being recorded in this document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ccgEU722Kz5kDrq0wmA5pd6Du05qAaWNN7kRaTlG9jU/edit

#### Three symbols

The symbols (a [dot](https://i.imgur.com/RvKX4CI.jpg), a [dash](https://i.imgur.com/LaZ3Fg4.jpg) and a [slash](https://i.imgur.com/v290XRN.jpg)), which had been previously used in the [printer strings](https://wiki.gamedetectives.net/index.php?title=Inside_ARG#Printer_Strings) might reveal another message or code. We have yet to find several consecutively numbered stickers, since that might be the order needed to arrange them. If this is the case, it is expected that it won't be required to gather ALL the stickers (many of them have already been confirmed to have been lost or thrown away), but rather a much smaller number of them (or so we hope!).

For instance, if the string was of 10 characters long, it could have been repeated 100 times to give it a very good margin of error. However, so far the printer strings have been far longer than that (often 32 characters long, across many lines).

#### 9 piece puzzle

Underneath the symbol of the sticker, there is one of nine different image textures comprised of little dots (which depending on the distance and angle, can be hard to be seen). When arranged together solving the mini-puzzle, [an image is formed](https://i.imgur.com/846shEE.jpg) (the letters A to I were added to identify each of the pieces). We had eventually contemplated that the solution was: `dat/534brn9653f9i8rnd` or `dat/534brn9653f9i8nmd`.

- March 20 - It is first considered that the code contained in the puzzle, could be a URL: `uat/5345rn9653f9i8nmd` ([discord source](https://discordapp.com/channels/460626942190813184/461275582970462209/690408214470328390))

- April 6 - A "C" image featuring a dash is found, thus enabling a clearer read on some of the characters which were partly concealed underneath a slash in all the previously found "C" images.  ([discord source](https://discordapp.com/channels/460626942190813184/461275582970462209/696749987991650315))
- Based on that sticker, there was now more evidence to believe there was a number 6 in the code. ([discord source](https://discordapp.com/channels/460626942190813184/461275582970462209/696860529813094420))
- April 20 - Youtubber oddheader [covers still unsolved easter eggs](https://youtu.be/ec_8HLCboDI) and mysteries in video games, INSIDE among them. Which attracts new people to the ARG and the Discord. ([discord source](https://discordapp.com/channels/460626942190813184/461275582970462209/701922554591314070))
- April 21 - A new discord member (attracted by said youtube video) looks into the Terminal41 website index and uncovers a few previously unknown URLs: `` http://terminal41.link/sys/terminate_terminal/41/terminate.html - 
http://terminal41.link/dat/534brn9653f9j8mmd/ - 
http://terminal41.link/sys/terminate_terminal/41/y/ - 
http://terminal41.link/sys/terminateall.html
`` ([discord source](https://discordapp.com/channels/460626942190813184/461275582970462209/702030280751317072))

**Explanation of what happened during the night of April 21st**

Someone looking into the index of http://terminal41.link/ found the above mentioned URLs. That's when this one: `http://terminal41.link/dat/534brn9653f9j8mmd/` was immediately recognized to be the solution to the 9 piece puzzle.

When going to `http://terminal41.link/sys/terminate_terminal/41/terminate.html` ([archived here](https://web.archive.org/web/20200421064134/http://terminal41.link/sys/terminate_terminal/41/terminate.html)) a prompt to terminate the terminal was proposed. Inputing "y" in the form of accessing `http://terminal41.link/sys/terminate_terminal/41/y/` is believed to have effectively terminated access to the entire Terminal 41 website.

**Puzzle SOLVED. Solution:**
	
	dat/534brn9653f9j8mmd

Leading to: `http://terminal41.link/dat/534brn9653f9j8mmd/` and the "534brn9653f9j8mmd Puzzle".

### 534brn9653f9j8mmd Puzzle

![Screenshot of terminal41.link/dat/534brn9653f9j8mmd/](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/461275582970462209/702051255672897566/unknown.png)

In the URL: `http://terminal41.link/dat/534brn9653f9j8mmd/` there was an HTML page with code for what seems to be a JPG image file.

The terminal41 site is since down, but we are hosting a copy of that page here: http://534brn9653f9j8mmd.surge.sh/

Besides the JPG file code, there are two other interesting things present at the very bottom:

	pe^!02un ........ .. . sys/ terminate terminal/ 41/ [conf.]

The last part is a URL for the terminal41 page `http://terminal41.link/sys/terminate_terminal/41/` which would have lead to this [archived page](https://web.archive.org/web/20200421064134/http://terminal41.link/sys/terminate_terminal/41/terminate.html).

When replacing terminate.html in the URL with a "y" confirmation (`http://terminal41.link/sys/terminate_terminal/41/y/`), we believe that's when the terminal site was effectively terminated, and thus why it can no longer be accessed.

This still leaves us with: `pe^!02un ........ .. .` Which we don't yet know where it fits or what it means.

As for the JPG file, it can't be converted as is. There are obfuscated characters which are in place of necessary bits of information.

### PS4 cover hidden mystery

On twitter, iam8bit (makers of the CE) [tweeted](https://twitter.com/iam8bit/status/1203007268930764800) explicitly stating that there is something hidden in the reversible cover of their PS4 edition of INSIDE.

This may be the same for their [individual PS4 physical copy](https://www.iam8bit.com/products/inside-ps4-physical-game), for which they state there is *"perhaps, more than it seems"*.
