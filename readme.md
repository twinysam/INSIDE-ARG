## About INSIDE & the ARG

INSIDE is a video game made by Playdead and first released in June 29, 2016. Early on, hidden things were discovered in the game. Some of those lead us to secret websites and other clues, and eventually puzzles started happening outside of the game. Playdead has been hinting at their [upcoming game](https://www.instagram.com/p/BPfgOnfBrKu/) with it.

The ongoing efforts to solve the puzzles and mysteries is happening at the unofficial Playdead Discord server: https://discord.gg/dS7uYDNzrw
